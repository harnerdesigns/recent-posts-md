# Recent Posts Markdown Generator

A WordPress Plugin that generates a Markdown list of links to your latest posts. Useful for driving traffic back to your blog from Medium or Dev.to

## Installation

_Working on getting it hosted on WordPress.org_

For now, to install and use, go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/harnerdesigns/recent-posts-md/releases) for the plugin and click "Zip" on the latest version.

Log in to your WordPress install and go to `Plugins > Add New`. Then hit `Upload Plugin` and select the zip you just downloaded. 

Tada! It should be installed. 

## Usage

Once installed, go to Tools > Recent Posts Markdown. Select what post type, and how many posts to include and hit submit! 

It will output something like this:

```
